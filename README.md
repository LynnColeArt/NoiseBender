# NoiseBender

Concept: What if noise paintings and other similar types of adversarial inputs could be generated by the machine? 

What if images could be scored for their likely distortion value? 

What if you could apply distortions to images to make them bend the ai or evaluate them for training? 

NoiseBender is a project I've wanted to do for a while, I just had no idea I've wanted to do it.

With this project, I am to say yes to all of these questions and more, as I embrace the inevitable scope creep that'll turn this project into a huge difficult to manage app!

Hey, my repo, my rules.

But this one's going to be interesting to a variety of different kinds of people for a variety of reasons.

Just don't take anything I do here too seriously.

Love you babies!
